# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

A data science project to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

## 🔍 Project Overview
- Performed full **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
- Applied **feature engineering and encoding**
- Built multiple models and compared accuracies

## ✅ Accuracy Achieved
- **Random Forest Classifier:** 82.6%
- **Logistic Regression:** 79.8%
- **Decision Tree:** 76.5%

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 Dataset
[Kaggle Titanic Dataset]("C:\Users\hp\Downloads\titanic\Titanic-Dataset.csv")

## 📌 Insights
- Females had higher survival chances than males
- 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate
- Age and fare also influenced survival
